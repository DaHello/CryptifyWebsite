// have html, where all pages start.
// so we should not have any html files
// index.html is just the sample code
// load the css into pages when program runs

// const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
// root.render(
//   <React.StrictMode>
//     <App />
//   </React.StrictMode>
// );

//in the hmtl, the div with the id "root" is the containter that will be used
//to render html contents
///I'm assuming that you can also do that with entire files, like in the code above, but as 
//we learn react we will figure things out.

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render( 
<p>HELLO, this is a test</p>
) // this is where the function call would happen for each html

//change the code aboce if you want to try it out and get an idea of how it works


// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function
// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))
// or send to an analytics endpoint. Learn more: https://bit.ly/CRA-vitals
reportWebVitals();
